Originally written by Adrian Black on his YouTube channel, this firmware allows for on the fly switching of Kernals on the Commodore64 all I did was clean and optimize his code.

This is untested (since I do not have the hardware to do so) and may have bugs, if you use this version and find issues please report them, and I will fix them.

Enjoy!
